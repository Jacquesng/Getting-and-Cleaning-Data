How to run the analysis pipeline
1) open the run_analysis.R
2) source the run_analysis.R file from your working dir.
 - If you do not have the dataset already downloaded, it will be downloaded and saved in a getdata folder within your working directory
 - The tidy dataset will be exported and saved to the root of your working directory

Thanks,
